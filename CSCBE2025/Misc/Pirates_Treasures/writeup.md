# Pirates Treasures

## Dificulty
1/4

## Description
Captain Hook left us a treasure map, but he hid it well, as any clever pirate would.
Heâ€™s left only a portrait of himself as a clue, grinning with that familiar glint in his eye.
Legend says he hides his secrets where no sailor would think to look.
Maybe there's something lurking beneath the surface...
