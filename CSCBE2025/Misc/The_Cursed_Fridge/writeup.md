# The Cursed Fridge

## Dificulty
1/4

## Description
During your travels through time, you've encountered many odd figures.

One of them became a good friend, John, and he spoke of many things he came across in his adventures.

One day, hearing of one of your many adventures pentesting a wizard's castle, he pulls out a rusty key, and slides it across the table.

"My friend", he says, "this, is my old, cursed fridge. I paid a pretty penny back in the day for it, but I had a disagreement with it, and it refuses my key now."
Confused, you look at him while reaching for the key, and, as if to play on your competitive spirit,
he adds "There's something very dear to me, an old flag, from a kingdom long forgotten. Maybe you could bear it's crown?"
