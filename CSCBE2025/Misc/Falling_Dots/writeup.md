## Description
You’ve been invited to participate in a top-secret challenge!
A cryptic investigation launched by a secretive organization called CyberSpaghetti Corp.
The company has recently unveiled a new AI-powered communication device.
They claim it is able to convey messages in a truly mesmerizing way.
Using these visual elements the human brain gets easily deranged.
It’s all a part of their next-generation AI communication system,
which promises Predictive Network Guards using Reinforced Guard Bots.
But I can't find any of those features!

## Solution
Create a python script to browse every pixel with a color different than the background and add the position and color of the pixel in an external file. Then build the new image based on the pixel color and position in the external file.
