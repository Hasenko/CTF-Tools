# The Non Deterministic Cipher

## Dificulty
1/4

## Description
Hello, my name is Pollux Moore. I have a fascination with algorithms, unpredictability, non-determinism and especially those mathematical relations where one input can map to multiple outputs!
Inspired by this concept, I’ve created what I call an "unbreakable" cipher.
From a single plaintext, you can generate many different ciphertexts!
To show you this, I’ve generated two different ciphertexts from the same plaintext.
Your task is to recover the original message hidden in it:

Note: I didn't have time to encrypt the symbols from the flag, so I added the "{" and "_" later, after the encryption process.
