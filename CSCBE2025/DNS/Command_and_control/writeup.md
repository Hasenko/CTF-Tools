## Description
IDS Alert: Suspicious DNS queries detected! An internal workstation has been sending DNS queries to smallbank.be,
and it’s raising some serious eyebrows.

This isn’t your usual traffic—something funky is happening at the protocol level.
The validating DNS resolver which triggered the IDS alert is 54.228.245.186

This is no ordinary DNS snooping mission. Sharpen your tools, dig deep (pun intended), and follow the packets.
