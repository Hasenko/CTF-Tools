# MyRPG3

## Dificulty
3/4

## Description
I don't think the bugs in my code are that big. In the end, you used my debug message and unfinished functions in all your exploits. So I'll just remove them all. It's easier than avoiding every possible bug. I also just learned the importance of having PIE enabled. So yeah, good luck exploiting that >:)
