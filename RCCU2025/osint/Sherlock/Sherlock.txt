An intercepted WhatsApp message reveals a plot to attack a police station. Unfortunately, the shared image doesn't reveal the location. 
After an unsuccessful search, a computer and a smartphone were found, but their contents revealed nothing. 
A USB drive was discovered with a zip file. The investigation hinges on discovering the location within a limited timeframe.
Participants must analyze the USB drive's contents in hopes of finding clues to solve the mystery and thwart the plot.
The pressure is intense, and every moment counts to avert the disaster. 
Additionally, a photo of the search location is attached to the exercise, potentially serving as the last crucial clue to crack the case.
