title : Pickle or Paprika

description :
    A python program to test unserialization. You can try it if you want !
    nc cybercrusade.helb-prigogine.be 5212

file given : pickleorpaprika.py

solution :
    I had to write a python script (test.py) to serialize a shell command. When done, I tried, 'ls /'.
    ls /, tell that flag.bK9fLMvHycoW486MqWdn.txt exist. So I did cat command and retrieve the flag.
