"""
Every Mobile challenge coulde be resolved using a single tool.

apktool on linux.

Using this command, I could decompile the apk file and access code, assets and more.

Every mobile challenge was made using MIT app inventor, so on the decompiled source code, I could have the flag (found using ctrl-f).

The last mobile challenge, Click0x000000, was solved in the same way. Instead of having the flag directly on the code, it was on an image TATAP.png.
The image was taken nearby the school, by going on the place, i could find the missing part of the image and get the flag.
