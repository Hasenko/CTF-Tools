description : Like a snail, I love binary !

file given : flag.png

solution :
    The solution here is to browse the image pattern in a spiral way from the center. When a black square is found, a 1 is added to a string, if it's a white square, add a 0.
    By continuing this to the end, the binarie string should be converted in ascii and the flag will be revealed.
